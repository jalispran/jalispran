## Summary:
This was one of the longest running projects that I had worked on. It had the toughest and most complicated business logic I had ever come across. Having said that, keeping the code simple, straightforward and easy to understand inspite of that amount of complexiety was a challenge in itself. Throughly enjoyed working on this one.

### Further reading:
Unlike others, this was not a project that was started from scratch. This was one of the project that was being used by users on a regular basis. However, this time it had major changes to be incorporated. These changes would reshape the entire project.

This project also was also integrated with [Loan Collection System](). This project basically focused on merchant payouts. For any instrument the merchant used, this project was capable of processing merchant payouts in the stipulated amount of time. 

*Merchant Settlement and Payout* is a complex topic. In addition to account for all the money that flows through the system, this project also gave operators the ability to hold merchant payouts in lieu of suspicious transactions. The aim of the project was to achieve *same day settlement*, in turn making the merchant happier.
