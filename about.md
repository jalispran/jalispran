I believe that Software Development is one of the greatest professions of this time. I consider myself privilaged to be able to live in the same era where one can witness rapid changes brought about by technology each day, and be surprised that a few lines of code can impact our lives in so many ways. What a great time to be alive! I try to live by Steve Jobs's philosophy

I am a firm believer in opensource software and its values. This blog is a way for me to give back to the community, that, with the amount of knowlede it has to offer, would never cease to amaze me. Its a great feeling that this blog is my little contribution to the community that we all belong to.

I started my career as Software Developer in September of 2017 and have been working since. For the first 18 months of my career, I worked with a fintech called **Mosambee**. This was an exceptional experience for me. Presently, I work with **Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore**.

I love to collaborate with like minded people on finding creative solutions to problems. Feel free to say hi at the following channels.
