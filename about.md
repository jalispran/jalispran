I believe Software Development is the greatest profession of this time. I love bing able to see the impact a few lines of code can make on people's lives. Also, I consider myself privilaged as to be able to live in the same era where I can actually witness the vast amount of changes technology is bringing each day to our lives. I try to live by Steve Jobs's philosophy

I greatly admire opensource projects and developer communities and hence, this blog is a way for me to give back to the community that would never cease to surprise me with the amount of knowledge it has to offer. I feel great that, through this blog, I can make a small contribution to the community.

I started my career as Software Developer in September of 2017 and have been working since. For the first 18 months of my career, I worked at a fintech called **Mosambee**, which was an exceptional experience for me. Presently, I work at **Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore**.

I love to collaborate with like minded people on finding creative solutions to problems. Feel free to say hi at the following channels.
